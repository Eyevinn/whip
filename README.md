| [@eyevinn/whip-endpoint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eyevinn/whip-endpoint) | Server endpoint for providing WHIP resources |
| [@eyevinn/whip-web-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eyevinn/whip-web-client) | Client Javascript SDK for browser based WHIP client (WebRTC producer) |

## Getting started

Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run development environment which will launch a demo / test page at http://localhost:1234 and a WHIP endpoint at http://localhost:8000/api/v1

```
npm run dev
```

### With TLS termination

```
NODE_ENV=development \ 
TLS_TERMINATION_ENABLED=true \
WHIP_ENDPOINT_USE_HTTPS=true \
BROADCAST_USE_HTTPS=true \
npm run dev
```

### Develop against demo backend

```
NODE_ENV=production npm run dev
```

To fetch ICE config from remote

```
API_KEY=<secret> ICE_CONFIG_REMOTE=1 NODE_ENV=production npm run dev
```

## TURN server

To run a TURN server locally you can use the Docker container of [coturn](https://hub.docker.com/r/coturn/coturn).

```
docker run -d -p 3478:3478 -p 3478:3478/udp -p 5349:5349 -p 5349:5349/udp -p 49160-49200:49160-49200/udp \
       coturn/coturn -n --log-file=stdout \
                        --external-ip='$(detect-external-ip)' \
                        --min-port=49160 --max-port=49200
```

And to use the above STUN/TURN server when developing

```
ICE_SERVERS=turn:<username>:<credential>@localhost:3478 npm run dev
```

## Run with a local SFU

### Build and run SFU

For requirements, see https://github.com/marcusspangenberg/SymphonyMediaBridge/blob/master/README.md

```
cd tools
./start_local_sfu.sh
